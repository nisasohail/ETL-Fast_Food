# Fast Food

Our group wanted to compare fast food restaurants with average incomes in certain areas. The csv dataset from data.world shows over 10,000 fast food restaurants and includes the restaurantâ€™s address, city, latitude and longitude coordinates, name, and more. The second csv dataset from Kaggle contains records on US Household Income Statistics & Geo Locations. Two CSV provide instant access to web data.
We wanted to see if there was any relationship between the number of fast food restaurants and the average income in particular areas (zip codes). The datasets were cleaned by renaming and excluding columns that were not pertinent. The datasets were then joined together on corresponding information.
It was then loaded onto PostgreSQL relational database.
